        <p>This page contains a reusable <code>&lt;counter-element&gt;</code>. The
        element is not built in a Redux-y way (you can think of it as being a
        third-party element you got from someone else), but this page is connected to the
        Redux store. When the element updates its counter, this page updates the values
        in the Redux store, and you can see the current value of the counter reflected in
        the bubble above.</p>
